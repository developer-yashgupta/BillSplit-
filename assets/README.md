# Assets Directory

This directory should contain:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon

For now, these are placeholder files. In production, you would:

1. Create proper app icons using tools like:
   - Figma
   - Canva
   - Icon generators

2. Use the 💸 emoji as inspiration for the app icon design

3. Use the brand color #6366f1 (indigo) for consistency

## Temporary Solution

The app will work without these files, but you'll see warnings in development.
To fix this properly, create the actual image files.
